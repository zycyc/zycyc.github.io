My name is Yicong (Alan) Zheng, a second-year psychology PhD student in UC Davis studying episodic memory. I am currently interested in how people use memory to guide decisions and make novel inferences in a spatial navigation setting, the biological and computaional mechanisms underlying these processes, and their possible interaction with AI, who will either borrow this wisdom from people or become smarter and more advanced than us using algorithms we don't know yet (afterall, we are just [type 0.72 civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale)). When not doing research, I enjoy singing in karaoke (before pandemic), playing badminton (before pandemic), listining to rocks & classical music, and exploring all tech-related stuff.
